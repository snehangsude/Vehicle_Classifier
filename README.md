To try it for yourself, please click <a href="https://bit.ly/3IaI5jD">here</a>

## Technologies Used
- Juyter Notebook
- Voila
- Binder
- Fastai/fastbook

This is hosted on Binder and uses Voila to display the output code cells. <br><br>
**Note**: Initally it would take 90 secs to load the Binder notebook. 
Also, error messages in the notebook can be a reason for dependencies however this wouldn't hamper the working of the model.
